- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @cocampo98

- üëÄ I‚Äôm an engineer with basic hands-on experience in computational mechanics, design optimization, numerical analysis, computer programming (Matlab, Python, C++, LabVIEW and VBA), parallel programming, cloud, and high-performance computing, including understanding the underlying physics and mathematics, translating the theory and mathematical tools into schemes, numerical methods, and algorithms; in addition to verifying the code implementation through unit and performance tests, and using a popular version control system (Git).

Professional Research Areas:

- Computational Mechanics (with a special interest in Solid Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Coupled Multi-Physics problems).
- Design Optimization of Structural, Fluid Dynamics, and Coupled Multi-Physics problems.
- Topology, Shape, and Size Optimization.
- Numerical Methods for Analysis and Optimization for Coupled Multi-Physics problems.
- Numerical Modeling and Design Optimization of Thermo-Fluidic Energy Systems.

*Structural Analysis Performed:

- Linear and Non-Linear Analysis.
- Modal and Dynamic Analysis: Modal, Harmonic, Spectral, Random vibrations, Rigid body, Implicit and Explicit Analysis.
- Linear and Non-Linear Buckling Analysis.
- Thermal and Thermo-structural Analysis.
- Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Study: Correlation Analysis, Sensitivity Analysis, DOE sampling, and Meta-model building. Topology, shape, and size Optimization.

*Fluid Dynamic Analysis Performed:

- Steady and Transient State simulations.
- Turbulent flow: Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes Simulation (RANS), and only theoretical understanding in Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Sub-Grid Scale models (SGS).
- Multiphase flow.
- Multispecies flow.
- Thermo-Fluidic Analysis.

More:

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI).
- :zap:I‚Äôd like to learn about Reactive fluxes and Combustion, Multiphysics (including EMAG), Advanced Fluid Mechanics, Turbulence, Fracture, Creep and Fatigue Mechanics, Additive Manufacturing, and OpenMPI.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on Academic or Industrial environments in which we can research, develop and innovate in technological solutions that can generate a social and technological impact together.
